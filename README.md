# Dataset Information

**Name**: Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System dataset

**Description**: This dataset is often used for public health research and epidemiological studies. It is collected and maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. The dataset is typically available in CSV format, making it easy to load and analyze using various data analysis tools and programming languages.

# Data Coverage 

The dataset covers a wide range of demographic, behavioral, and health-related information for survey respondents. It includes data on individuals' lifestyles, habits, and self-reported health conditions.

# Data Cleaning

In the data cleaning process, we removed unnecessary columns that had null values and were duplicates of other columns. We also created a pie chart to visualize the distribution of survey questions and made boxplots to explore the topics covered between data values and location descriptions.

# Data Visualization

We used various data visualization techniques, including heatmaps to find correlations between columns (although there was a low correlation), and boxplots for Low_Confidence_Limit and High_Confidence_Limit to examine value distributions.

# Model Training & Evaluation

Our model training focused on Income and Education features. We discovered that there was no significant difference in Train_RMSE, Test_RMSE, Train_MAE, and Test_MAE for different datasets, allowing us to consider any of them.
