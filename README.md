Course Project 1 for the subject of Introduction to data mining.
# Dataset Information :
Name : Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor  Surveillance System dataset
This dataset is often used for public health research and epidemiological studies. The dataset is collected and maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. The dataset is typically available in CSV format, making it easy to load and analyze using various data analysis tools and programming languages.
Data Coverage:
The dataset covers a wide range of demographic, behavioral, and health-related information for survey respondents. It includes data on individuals' lifestyles, habits, and self-reported health conditions
Data Cleaning:
Here we Drop Some  Unnecessary columns which have null values and duplicate of other columns .we plot piechart of how many percentages question would be asked. We make boxplot for how many topic covers between data_value-LocationDes.
Data Visualization:
Heatmaps were drawn to find correlations between columns, but there was a low correlation. A boxplot for Low_Confidence_Limit and High_Confidence_Limit showed most values falling.
Model Training& Evaluation :
We trained our model by focusing on Income and Education features. We found that there is no significant difference in Train_RMSE, Test_RMSE, Train_MAE, and Test_MAE for different datasets, allowing us to consider any of them.
