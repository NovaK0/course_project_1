# Work Distribution:
<br>
We have divided the dataset as per classes. Every member is selecting a particular class and observing the variations and predicing the Data_Value.
<br>
For the methodolgy and results every branch has a separate readme file and individual observations are written there. 
<br>
For the master branch observations are written at end of the code.
